Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
The goal of the application was to fulfil a task required by a CS course. The program allows the user to make a list of courses they can take without allowing them to go over the credit limit.
What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
I think I did a good job in making it efficient and clean in the workspace.
Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The design used no more than what was needed to create an efficient app to take care of the requirements. the drop down bar makes things easier to select and the button confirms the registration for the selected course. There is an area that gives information on what the user is doing and a box with a list of which courses were selected and another with total credits. With no bulk it works well as intended.
How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
If I can't figure out what's going wrong with the program after taking a look at all the lines, I try different things with different parts of the code to get a feel of what might be affecting things while I try to think about what's going wrong. Trying things out is better than staring at the code and wondering where things are going wrong sometimes.
Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
When debugging the program at one part I was stumped at one point and had to scour the program to fix it. In doing so I checked an area I wouldn't usually expect a problem to be at and in doing so fixed the program.
